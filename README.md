### Contribution

**DO NOT PUSH TO MASTER**

Pull `develop` branch and create a branch from there.

For new features

`git branch feature/feature-name`

For bugfixes

`git branch bugfix/bugfix-name`

When you are done, run `npm run lint` to make sure you have no code style errors.
After you are sure you want to push

`git push origin feature/feature-name`

And come to this repo to create a pull request, from that branch to develop (base).
